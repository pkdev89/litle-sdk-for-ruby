Running the built in configuration file generator

The Litle configuration file has been generated, the file is located at: /<your-home-directory>/.litle_SDK_config.yml

You may change the configuration values at anytime by running Setup.rb again, or simpy opening the configuration file directly in the editor of your choice and changing the appropriate fields.
